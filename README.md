Platformer made between friends Sam Westerlund and Benjamin Rosenlund.

## ideas

- Platformer with shooting elements
- Directional shooting based on crouching
    - crouching gives downward momentum to the shots, letting go gives upward momentum. We need to nail the timing feel.
    - Could be independent of jumping momentum -> shooting in air works the same as on the ground
    - The directions might not necessarily needed to be animated on the avatar. It might make the character more alive-looking and bouncy tho.
