A pico-8 platformer made by friends Sam Westerlund and Benjamin Rosenlund.

## concept

- Platformer with shooting elements
- Procedurally generated (we loove unlimited content)
    - level (or room) based design
    - Gets harder and harder
    - Rouge-like
- Enemies and map geometry can get shot


## ideas

- Platformer with shooting elements
- Procedurally generated (we loove unlimited content)
- Directional shooting based on 'crouching' mechanic
    - crouching gives downward momentum to the shots, letting go gives upward momentum. We need to nail the feel of the timing.
    - Could be independent of jumping momentum -> shots fired while moving have the same momentum as shots fired while standing still.
    - The directions might not necessarily needed to be animated on the avatar. It might make the character more alive-looking and bouncy tho.
